# Football-Position-Needs

__This project is not yet finished__
  
This project was inspired by Manchester Uniteds current struggles. As of 2025, Manchester United have changed their Head Coach to Ruben Amorim, who plays a much different style and formation to what the squad is formed to. Manchester United is also in great financial struggles as mentioned by the part-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe. Therefore Manchester United have to be smarter with their money, whilst a squad turnover is needed to support the new managers vision. It is therefore important for the club to be looking for great deals in the market, and thus this project seeks to give a tool to do exactly this.

## Tech stack and more

For this project I will use Python and SQL mainly. This is due to the languages ease of use when it comes to managing and gathering data. 
The data will be put into a database via SQL lite, from which I will visualise the data using Power BI.

The data will be scraped from transfermarkt.com and fbref.com. Transfermarkt provides a great and vast database of players which provide an estimated valuation, which otherwise can be tricky to get. (See how transfermarkt determines value: https://www.transfermarkt.co.in/transfermarkt-market-value-explained-how-is-it-determined-/view/news/385100) 

Fbref is a site which provides a great amount of data provided by Opta and Data Sports Group. There is data for 'over 20 competitions including the big five mens European leagues, Champions League, World Cup, Copa Libertadores and top leagues in Brazil, Portugal, the Netherlands, United States and Mexico'.
