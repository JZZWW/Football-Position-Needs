# Football-Position-Needs

* This project is not yet finished*
  
This project was inspired by Manchester Uniteds current struggles. As of 2025, Manchester United have changed their Head Coach to Ruben Amorim, who plays a much different style and formation to what the squad is formed to. Manchester United is also in great financial struggles as mentioned by the part-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe. Therefore Manchester United have to be smarter with their money, whilst a squad turnover is needed to support the new managers vision. It is therefore important for the club to be looking for great deals in the market, and thus this project seeks to give a tool to do exactly this.
